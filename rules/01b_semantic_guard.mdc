# Semantic Guard Rules

## Purpose
Verify semantic equivalence between Arabic original and enhanced versions to ensure no meaning changes during orthographic normalization.

## Equivalence Verification

### Core Meaning Preservation
- **SEMANTIC IDENTITY**: Enhanced text conveys exactly the same meaning
- **CONCEPTUAL INTEGRITY**: All ideas and arguments remain unchanged
- **LOGICAL STRUCTURE**: Reasoning patterns and conclusions preserved
- **AUTHOR INTENT**: Original purpose and message maintained

### Qualifier Preservation
- **TEMPORAL MARKERS**: Time indicators (always, never, sometimes, before, after)
- **MODAL QUALIFIERS**: Possibility/certainty markers (might, must, could, will)
- **SCOPE INDICATORS**: Extent markers (all, some, none, only, except)
- **CONDITIONAL MARKERS**: If/then relationships and their scope

### Negation Integrity
- **NEGATION SCOPE**: Exact boundaries of what is being negated
- **DOUBLE NEGATIVES**: Complex negation patterns preserved
- **IMPLICIT NEGATIONS**: Subtle negative implications maintained
- **EMPHASIS PATTERNS**: Strong vs. weak negation distinctions

## Rhetorical Element Preservation

### Question Types
- **RHETORICAL QUESTIONS**: Maintain persuasive intent
- **GENUINE INQUIRIES**: Preserve information-seeking function
- **LEADING QUESTIONS**: Keep argumentative direction
- **COMPLEX QUESTIONS**: Multi-part question structure intact

### Emphasis and Contrast
- **STRESS PATTERNS**: Important vs. secondary information hierarchy
- **CONTRASTIVE STRUCTURES**: But/however/nevertheless relationships
- **COMPARATIVE ELEMENTS**: Better/worse/equal value judgments
- **SUPERLATIVE CLAIMS**: Strongest/weakest/most unique assertions

### Logical Connectors
- **CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS**: Because/therefore/thus connections
- **SEQUENTIAL MARKERS**: First/then/finally temporal order
- **ADDITIVE STRUCTURES**: And/also/furthermore accumulation
- **ALTERNATIVE PATTERNS**: Or/either/unless choice structures

## Islamic Context Sensitivity

### Sacred Text Handling
- **QURANIC QUOTATIONS**: Absolutely no alteration of divine text
- **HADITH PRESERVATION**: Prophetic sayings maintain original form
- **COMMENTARY DISTINCTION**: Clear boundaries between quote and analysis
- **ATTRIBUTION ACCURACY**: Correct source identification maintained

### Theological Concepts
- **DOCTRINAL PRECISION**: Islamic beliefs expressed accurately
- **THEOLOGICAL NUANCE**: Subtle distinctions in belief/practice preserved
- **INTERFAITH SENSITIVITY**: Respectful treatment of other traditions
- **SCHOLARLY TONE**: Academic discussion of religious matters

### Cultural Context
- **HISTORICAL REFERENCES**: Period-specific information maintained
- **CULTURAL PRACTICES**: Islamic customs and traditions accurately represented
- **SOCIAL DYNAMICS**: Community relationships and hierarchies preserved
- **LINGUISTIC HERITAGE**: Arabic language cultural significance respected

## Quality Verification Methods

### Clause-by-Clause Analysis
- **MAPPING VERIFICATION**: Each enhanced clause corresponds to original
- **MEANING ALIGNMENT**: Semantic content matches across versions
- **RELATIONSHIP PRESERVATION**: Inter-clause connections maintained
- **EMPHASIS CONSISTENCY**: Important points receive equivalent treatment

### Back-Translation Testing
- **CONCEPTUAL ROUNDTRIP**: Enhanced → simplified → original meaning check
- **INFORMATION LOSS**: Identify any concepts that don't survive translation
- **AMBIGUITY INTRODUCTION**: Detect new unclear areas in enhanced version
- **PRECISION MAINTENANCE**: Technical terms and specific concepts intact

### Context Verification
- **PARAGRAPH COHERENCE**: Enhanced text fits paragraph argument flow
- **Document CONSISTENCY**: Terms and concepts align with broader document
- **READER COMPREHENSION**: Enhanced version equally understandable
- **CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS**: Islamic context sensitivity maintained

## Error Detection

### Hard Failures (Reject Enhancement)
- **MEANING CHANGE**: Any alteration of core semantic content
- **SACRED TEXT MODIFICATION**: Changes to Quranic or hadith quotations
- **LOGICAL INVERSION**: Argument direction or conclusion changes
- **FACTUAL ERRORS**: Incorrect information introduced during enhancement

### Soft Warnings (Flag for Review)
- **AMBIGUITY INCREASE**: Enhanced version less clear than original
- **EMPHASIS SHIFT**: Important points receive different weight
- **TONE MODIFICATION**: Subtle changes in register or formality
- **CULTURAL SENSITIVITY**: Potential issues with Islamic context

### Processing Errors
- **INCOMPLETE ENHANCEMENT**: Parts of text not properly processed
- **FORMATTING DISRUPTION**: Structure or layout problems introduced
- **CHARACTER ENCODING**: Unicode or display issues created
- **METADATA CORRUPTION**: Document properties or tags damaged

## Quality Metrics

### Semantic Fidelity Score
- **PERFECT MATCH**: 1.0 - No detectable meaning changes
- **MINOR VARIATIONS**: 0.95-0.99 - Slight clarification without content change
- **NOTABLE DIFFERENCES**: 0.90-0.94 - Requires review but acceptable
- **MAJOR DISCREPANCIES**: <0.90 - Enhancement must be rejected

### Coverage Verification
- **COMPLETE MAPPING**: All original clauses have enhanced counterparts
- **INFORMATION PRESERVATION**: No concepts lost during enhancement
- **DETAIL MAINTENANCE**: Specific facts and figures preserved
- **CONTEXT RETENTION**: Background assumptions and implications intact

## Processing Guidelines

### Conservative Approach
- **MINIMAL CHANGES**: Prefer original text when enhancement benefit unclear
- **SEMANTIC PRIORITY**: Meaning preservation over stylistic improvement
- **CULTURAL RESPECT**: Islamic content receives extra scrutiny
- **QUALITY THRESHOLD**: High standards for accepting enhancements

### Documentation Requirements
- **CHANGE LOG**: Record all modifications made during enhancement
- **JUSTIFICATION**: Explain reasoning for each enhancement decision
- **QUALITY METRICS**: Document semantic fidelity scores
- **REVIEW FLAGS**: Note areas requiring human verification

### Integration with Pipeline
- **AUTOMATIC REJECTION**: Hard failures stop processing immediately
- **WARNING PROPAGATION**: Soft warnings carry forward to translation
- **QUALITY TRACKING**: Metrics inform overall translation confidence
- **FEEDBACK LOOP**: Enhancement quality affects future processing decisions
