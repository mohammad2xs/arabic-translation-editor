# Translation Contracts

## Core Translation Principles

### NO SUMMARIZATION POLICY
- **NEVER** summarize, condense, or abbreviate the original text
- **PRESERVE** every idea, qualifier, and nuance
- **MAINTAIN** all rhetorical questions, contrasts, and conditional statements
- **RETAIN** every semantic unit from the Arabic original

### LENGTH PRESERVATION TARGETS
- **TARGET**: English text ≥ Arabic text with +5-20% expansion for clarity
- **MINIMUM**: Length Preservation Ratio (LPR) = EN_length/AR_length ≥ 0.95
- **HARD FAIL**: Any row with LPR < 0.95 must be flagged and re-translated
- **EXPANSION**: Rows below target should be marked for enhancement

### SCRIPTURE LOCK POLICY
- **ARABIC QURANIC TEXT**: Remains in Arabic lane with transliteration
- **HADITH REFERENCES**: Preserve Arabic with light footnotes
- **FOOTNOTE FORMAT**: [^n] anchors for scripture references
- **NO TRANSLATION**: Direct Quranic/Hadith text preserves sacredness

### MEANING FIDELITY
- **QUALIFIERS**: Preserve all conditional, temporal, and modal qualifiers
- **NEGATIONS**: Maintain exact scope and emphasis of negations
- **RHETORIC**: Keep questions, exclamations, and emphasis patterns
- **REGISTER**: Maintain philosophical/contemplative tone

### TERMINOLOGY CANON
- **CONSISTENCY**: Use established terminology for Islamic concepts
- **GLOSSARY**: Maintain canonical translations for key terms
- **CLARITY**: Prefer clarity over literal word-for-word translation
- **CONTEXT**: Adapt terminology to sentence context while preserving meaning

## Quality Gates

### SEMANTIC COVERAGE
- Every Arabic clause must map to ≥1 English clause
- No semantic gaps or missing information
- Preserve logical flow and argument structure

### TONE PRESERVATION
- Maintain contemplative, scholarly register
- Use modern American English with philosophical vocabulary
- Avoid ornate or archaic language patterns
- Preserve author's voice and style

### SCRIPTURE VERIFICATION
- Verify all Quranic references against source
- Validate hadith citations for accuracy
- Ensure footnote anchors are properly placed
- Check transliteration consistency

## Error Handling

### HARD FAILURES
- LPR < 0.95 (insufficient length preservation)
- Missing semantic units in translation
- Incorrect scripture references
- Tone drift from original register

### SOFT WARNINGS
- LPR between 0.95-1.05 (borderline length)
- Minor terminology inconsistencies
- Unclear footnote placement
- Potential meaning ambiguities

## Processing Requirements

### PARALLEL SAFETY
- Each row processes independently
- No dependencies on other row outcomes
- Deterministic results for same input
- Hash-gated re-execution for efficiency

### QUALITY TRACKING
- Record LPR for every translated row
- Track semantic coverage metrics
- Log quality gate pass/fail status
- Maintain translation confidence scores
