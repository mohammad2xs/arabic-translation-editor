# English Style Guard Contract

## Purpose
Preserve contemplative tone, authorial voice, and philosophical register while ensuring clarity and accessibility for general educated audiences (grade 8-11 reading level).

## Core Principles

### 1. Voice Preservation
- **PRESERVE**: All qualifiers, modal verbs, and tentative language that convey humility and uncertainty
- **PRESERVE**: Rhetorical questions that engage the reader in contemplation
- **PRESERVE**: Negations and contradictions that show intellectual nuance
- **PRESERVE**: First-person perspective and personal reflections
- **FORBIDDEN**: Summarization, condensation, or removal of substantive content

### 2. Tone Maintenance
Reference: `rules/03_tone_guardian.mdc` - maintain consistency with established philosophical register
- Keep contemplative, reflective quality
- Preserve intellectual humility through modal qualifiers
- Maintain questioning stance and intellectual curiosity
- Retain personal vulnerability and authentic voice

### 3. Clarity Without Compromise
- Clarify only when meaning is genuinely ambiguous
- Break overlong sentences (>30 words) while preserving all semantic content
- Simplify word choice only when simpler alternatives carry identical meaning
- Maintain clause-level semantic alignment - no content reorganization

### 4. US Punctuation Standards
- Use serial commas consistently
- Apply US quotation mark conventions
- Follow standard capitalization rules
- Maintain consistent formatting throughout

### 5. Islamic Terminology Standards
- **First mention**: Provide glossing for Arabic/Islamic terms
- **Subsequent mentions**: Use term without repetitive glossing
- Maintain glossary consistency across all documents
- Preserve Arabic term pronunciation guides where provided

## Quality Gates
- Target reading grade: 8-11 (Flesch-Kincaid)

- No addition of new ideas or interpretations
- Maintain original paragraph structure and flow

## Prohibited Transformations
- Changing authorial stance or perspective
- Removing qualifiers that show intellectual humility
- Converting questions to statements
- Summarizing or condensing arguments
- Adding explanatory content not in source
- Reorganizing content structure beyond sentence-level clarity

## Success Criteria
Text that maintains the author's contemplative voice while being accessible to educated general readers without specialized Islamic knowledge.
