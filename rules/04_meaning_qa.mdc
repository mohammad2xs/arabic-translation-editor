# Meaning QA Rules

## Purpose
Verify Arabic-English translation fidelity through comprehensive analysis including back-translation checks, qualifier preservation verification, and rhetoric alignment confirmation.

## Fidelity Verification

### Back-Translation Testing
- **CONCEPTUAL ROUNDTRIP**: English → Arabic → English meaning consistency
- **INFORMATION PRESERVATION**: All original concepts survive the translation cycle
- **DETAIL MAINTENANCE**: Specific facts, figures, and qualifications retained
- **SEMANTIC STABILITY**: Core meaning remains unchanged through back-translation
- **CULTURAL CONTEXT**: Islamic concepts maintain appropriate significance

### Qualifier Preservation
- **TEMPORAL MARKERS**: Time-related qualifiers (always, never, before, after, during)
- **MODAL INDICATORS**: Certainty/possibility markers (must, might, could, should, will)
- **SCOPE QUALIFIERS**: Extent indicators (all, some, none, only, most, few)
- **CONDITIONAL STRUCTURES**: If/then relationships and their exact conditions
- **QUANTITATIVE PRECISION**: Numbers, measurements, and proportional relationships

### Logical Structure Integrity
- **ARGUMENT PROGRESSION**: Reasoning flows correctly from premises to conclusions
- **CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS**: Because/therefore connections properly maintained
- **COMPARATIVE STRUCTURES**: Better/worse/equal relationships accurately represented
- **SEQUENTIAL ORDER**: First/then/finally temporal progressions preserved
- **HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION**: Main points vs. supporting details clearly distinguished

## Rhetoric Alignment

### Question Preservation
- **RHETORICAL QUESTIONS**: Persuasive intent maintained in English
- **GENUINE INQUIRIES**: Information-seeking function preserved
- **COMPLEX QUESTIONS**: Multi-part questions retain complete structure
- **LEADING QUESTIONS**: Argumentative direction and emphasis maintained
- **ANSWER IMPLICATIONS**: Questions that suggest specific answers retain that quality

### Emphasis Patterns
- **STRESS DISTRIBUTION**: Important vs. secondary information hierarchy preserved
- **REPETITION EFFECTS**: Intentional repetition for emphasis maintained
- **CONTRAST STRUCTURES**: But/however/nevertheless relationships clear
- **SUPERLATIVE CLAIMS**: Strongest/most/least assertions properly emphasized
- **CLIMACTIC ORGANIZATION**: Building intensity or importance patterns preserved

### Stylistic Elements
- **METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE**: Figurative expressions appropriately translated
- **IDIOMATIC PATTERNS**: Arabic expressions rendered with equivalent English effect
