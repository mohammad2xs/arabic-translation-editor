## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Start Enhanced Development
```bash
# Start with all enhancements
npm run dev:full

# Start with monitoring only
npm run dev:monitored

# Start monitoring system
npm run monitor:start
```

### 2. Use New Components
```tsx
import ErrorBoundary from '@/app/(components)/ErrorBoundary';
import PerformanceMonitor from '@/app/(components)/PerformanceMonitor';
import MonitoringDashboard from '@/app/(components)/MonitoringDashboard';

// Wrap components with error boundary
<ErrorBoundary component="my-component">
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>

// Monitor performance
<PerformanceMonitor componentName="my-component">
  <MyComponent />
</PerformanceMonitor>

// Show monitoring dashboard
<MonitoringDashboard showDetails={true} />
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
```typescript
import { logger } from '@/lib/logging/console-ninja';

// Use enhanced logging
logger.info('Operation completed', { 
  component: 'my-component',
  duration: 150,
  success: true 
});

logger.performance('API call', 250, { endpoint: '/api/data' });
logger.trackError(error, { context: 'user-action' });
```

## üîß Configuration

### 1. Console Ninja Configuration
The logging system is pre-configured with:
- Structured logging format
- Component-specific loggers
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

### 2. Self-Healing System
The self-healing system monitors:
- Database connectivity
- API endpoints health
- Memory usage
- File system health
- Environment variables

### 3. Performance Monitoring
Performance monitoring tracks:
