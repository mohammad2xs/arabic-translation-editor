In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is a comprehensive study of the human being: his essence and constitution, the secret of his existence, and the mysteries of his psychological depths and his moral and ethical formation. What is his true reality? What is the secret of his existence? What is the secret of his constitution? What is he composed of? And is he merely a body with a mind?

Does he merely receive from his surroundings and analyze their substances, as many Western non-Muslim philosophers and scientists have assumed and continue to assume? Or is he a special creation that God created and placed upon this earth, making him its master and subjugating for him all that is within and upon it, and placing within him a special *fiṭrah* that distinguishes him from all around him?

## وقد تكلم القدماء من الاغريق وغيرهم عن النفس، فاختلفوا فيها فمن قال هي تموت بموت الانسان , ومن قال انها تبقى خالده .

Anaxagoras says: The *nafs* (soul)[^2] dies and departs from the body after its death.

<!-- ROW_ID: S007-002 | SECTION: S007 | TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-28T16:57:16.978Z -->
As for Empedocles, he holds that the *nafs* and the body share in death, while Aristocles holds that the *nafs* separates from the body and connects with the *rūḥāniyyīn* (spiritual beings)[^3], by which he means the angels and demons.

As for Islamic philosophers, they responded to Western philosophers with their own logic, to refute their arguments. Ibn Rushd (Averroes) demonstrated that the *nafs* remains eternal after the body's death, and he explained his view based on two positions of al-Ghazali: "If the *nafs* were to cease existing, its cessation would not be free from three possible states: either it ceases to exist along with the body, or it ceases to exist due to some opposing existing force, or it ceases to exist by the power of the All-Powerful."

## وبما أن الرأس والقلب هما وزيرا الاميرين الروح والنفس المتضادين، فالرأس للنفس، والقلب للروح.

The head (*ra's*)[^4] employs only the senses, so through it the human being attains nothing but worldly (*dunyawiyyah*)[^5] benefits.

<!-- ROW_ID: S013-002 | SECTION: S013 | TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-28T16:57:16.978Z -->
The *nafs* shows the body what its senses have perceived, then commands it to seek these things and pursue them with all its greed and desire.

<!-- ROW_ID: S013-003 | SECTION: S013 | TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-28T16:57:16.978Z -->
But the *nafs* cannot perceive what the *rūḥ* calls it to regarding the benefits of the *ākhirah* (Hereafter)[^6], even if it strives and attempts to understand and perceive.

## ما هي العوامل المؤثرة في التفاعل الفطري مع المحيط لتكوين شخصية الانسان وإنسانيته الحضارية:

Let us begin our investigation with the question: Is civilization a unified primordial (*fiṭrī*)[^8] human product present in all people?

<!-- ROW_ID: S021-002 | SECTION: S021 | TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-28T16:57:16.978Z -->
Or is it humanity that influences its environment, fashions it, and shapes its form and character in a way that harmonizes and aligns with its *fiṭrah* and essential humanity?

*Fiṭrah*: It is the constitution upon which God created the human being. God the Exalted says: "فطرة الله التي فطر الناس عليها لا تبديل لخلق الله ذلك الدين القيم" (*fiṭrat Allāh allatī faṭara al-nās ʿalayhā lā tabdīl li-khalq Allāh dhālik al-dīn al-qayyim*)[^9]

This is a description of the Noble Quran (represented by the glass vessel) as though it were a brilliant star (*kaukab durrī*) in its illumination and exposition, and in the wisdom and exhortation it brought—which illuminated the insight of the believers, showed all humanity the path of goodness, righteousness, and reform, and brought forth nations from darknesses into light. It is like a lustrous pearl and brilliant star in its illumination, the blazing of its radiance, and its effulgent light that cannot be hidden from one who reads it and contemplates it with insight and spiritual perception. It is brilliant and luminous in exposition and elucidation, containing healing for what lies within hearts. Its light has dominion over all the lights that came with messengers before, as God the Exalted said: "مهيمنا عليه" (*muhayminan ʿalayhi*)—meaning, having dominion through its effulgent light over all lights, adding to them light upon light (*nūr ʿalā nūr*), just as the illuminated believing hearts increase in light upon the light already within them.

## وفي قوله تعالى (يكاد زيتها يضيء ولو لم تمسسه نار) فهنا التأكيد على ان فطرة الانسان

When the light of the Quran touches that sound heart illuminated by the light of sound *fiṭrah*—which still remembers its Lord's covenant—the human being increases in light upon light (*nūr ʿalā nūr*): the light of the heart kindled from *fiṭrah* together with the light of the heavenly message (*nūr al-risālah al-samāwiyyah*).

## ولتوضيح الهداية في هذه الآية يجب ان بين أن الهداية نوعان.

<!-- ROW_ID: S027-001 | SECTION: S027 | TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-28T16:57:16.978Z -->
When guidance (*hidāyah*) is mentioned in the Book of God, it comes in two types: guidance of indication (*hidāyat al-dalālah*) and guidance of divine enabling (*hidāyat al-tawfīq*).

## وأما الذين لم تستطع تلك الموجات المعرفية ان تخترق غشاوة الظلامة التي على القلب فسوف يبقى في تلك الدائرة المظلمة.

Hearts that have been veiled by three darknesses (*ẓulumāt thalāth*)—(1) the ego's desires (*hawā al-nafs*), (2) Satan's misguidance and his whispers (*waswāsa*), and (3) the misguidance of human beings—are in triple darkness, never perceiving light. "For whomever God does not appoint light, he has no light." God the Exalted says in *Sūrat al-Nūr*: "أو كظلمات في بحر لجي يغشاه موج من فوقه موج من فوقه سحاب ظلمات بعضها فوق بعض إذا أخرج يده لم يكد يراها ومن لم يجعل الله له نور فما له من نور" (*aw ka-ẓulumātin fī baḥrin lujjiyyin yagshāhu mawjun min fawqihi mawjun min fawqihi saḥābun ẓulumātun baʿḍuhā fawqa baʿḍin idhā akhraja yadahu lam yakad yarāhā wa-man lam yajʿal Allāhu lahu nūran fa-mā lahu min nūr*)[^16]. The first two darknesses from the ocean's waves are from within the sea, representing in the human being the ego's desires (*hawā al-nafs*) and Satan's whispers that course through the human being like blood through his arteries. As for the clouds, they are the shadows and darkness coming from the external environment—the human devils (*shayāṭīn al-ins*) who surround the human being from every side like clouds surrounding the sea. This human being veiled by these three darknesses cannot see light, even if everything were assembled before him calling him to God's light. "For whomever God does not appoint light, he has no light."

## وحدانية الله واليوم الاخر عند غير المؤمنين :

<!-- ROW_ID: S031-002 | SECTION: S031 | TIMESTAMP: 2025-09-28T16:57:16.978Z -->
The first of these causes is the clouding of the *fiṭrah* by sins (*tashawwush al-fiṭrah bi'l-dhunūb*), which dim the lights of spiritual insight (*anwār al-baṣīrah*), rendering it unable to perceive the greatness of its Lord and Creator, the Mighty, the Compeller. This deficiency in perceiving God's greatness led them to assign Him rivals, partners, and helpers, or to deny His existence altogether. "Whoever is ignorant of the craft is ignorant of the Craftsman." These people failed to perceive the greatness of God's creation, His governance, and His predetermination. They proceeded to launch expectations and conjectures, claiming these to be the reality and essence of that magnificent creation. Then others came after them and invalidated those theories with other theories due to differences in their perspective and reflection upon the greatness of those existents. Among them were those who stopped thinking and rejected all interpretations that came before them, living in the unknown darkness of their souls. Among them were those who saw the Creator's greatness in it—some believed in Him while others rejected Him through injustice and hostility toward the truth and reality that appeared to them. All of this stems from their lack of perception and ignorance of God's greatness. Therefore they assigned Him partners from His creation, due to their minds' inability to perceive their Creator's greatness.

## البحث عن الإله لمخاطبته:

This detailed pictorial description of Abraham's dialogue with his people—as he confronted them with the reality of their deities: that they do not speak, are unable to defend themselves, and cannot inform about who shattered and dishonored them—shows how he attempted to remove that darkness from their spiritual insight (*baṣīrah*) so they would know the reality of what they worship and return to the depths of their hearts' intellects to see the truth. They were stunned by his confrontation with the reality of their objects of worship. They hung their heads in shame at the reality of what they worshiped and returned to themselves, confessing that they were the misguided ones. "They said: 'Indeed, you are the wrongdoers!'"—*within themselves*. Then they hung their heads in shame and said to Abraham with their heads lowered: "You know well that these do not speak." But their obstinacy (*ʿinād*) and pride (*kibriyāʾ*) prevented them from yielding to the truth and turning away from misguidance and caprice (*hawā*). So their pride answered—with head still lowered—through rage and vengeance against Abraham.
