This deficiency in perceiving God's greatness led them to assign Him rivals, partners, and helpers, or to deny His existence altogether. \"Whoever is ignorant of the craft is ignorant of the Craftsman.\" These people failed to perceive the greatness of God's creation, His governance, and His predetermination. They proceeded to launch expectations and conjectures, claiming these to be the reality and essence of that magnificent creation. Then others came after them and invalidated those theories with other theories due to differences in their perspective and reflection upon the greatness of those existents. Among them were those who stopped thinking and rejected all interpretations that came before them, living in the unknown darkness of their souls. Among them were those who saw the Creator's greatness in it—some believed in Him while others rejected Him through injustice and hostility toward the truth and reality that appeared to them. All of this stems from their lack of perception and ignorance of God's greatness. Therefore they assigned Him partners from His creation, due to their minds' inability to perceive their Creator's greatness.",

They were stunned by his confrontation with the reality of their objects of worship. They hung their heads in shame at the reality of what they worshiped and returned to themselves, confessing that they were the misguided ones. \"They said: 'Indeed, you are the wrongdoers!'\"—*within themselves*.

So their pride answered—with head still lowered—through rage and vengeance against Abraham.",
