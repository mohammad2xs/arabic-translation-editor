### Row S002-001
**Arabic:** بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم هذا مبحث شامل في الانسان، ماهيته وتكوينه، وسر وجوده، وأسرار اغواره النفسية ولتكوينه الخلقي والخلقي، ما حقيقته؟ وما سر وجوده؟ وما سر تكوينه؟ ومما يتكون؟ وهل هو جسد بعقل!

**English:** In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is a comprehensive study of the human being: his essence and constitution, the secret of his existence, and the mysteries of his psychological depths and his moral and ethical formation.

*LPR: 1.78*

### Row S002-002

**English:** Does he merely receive from his surroundings and analyze their substances, as many Western non-Muslim philosophers and scientists have assumed and continue to assume?

### Row S007-001
**Arabic:** يقول أنقاغورس : إن النفس تموت وتفارق الجسد بعد موته .

**English:** Anaxagoras says: The *nafs* (soul)[^2] dies and departs from the body after its death.

### Row S007-002
**Arabic:** أما انباذقليس فيرى: أن النفس والجسد يشتركان في الموت، اما ارسطوكاليس فيرى ان: النفس تفارق الجسم وتتصل بالروحانيين، ويقصد بهم الملائكة والشياطين.

**English:** As for Empedocles, he holds that the *nafs* and the body share in death, while Aristocles holds that the *nafs* separates from the body and connects with the *rūḥāniyyīn* (spiritual beings)[^3], by which he means the angels and demons.

*LPR: 1.36*

### Row S007-003
**Arabic:** أما فلاسفة الاسلام فقد ردوا على فلاسفة الغرب بمنطقهم، ليدحضوا حججهم، فبين أبن الرشد أن النفس تبقى خالدة بعد موت الجسم، وفسر رأيه استنادا إلى قولين للغزالي: "إن النفس إن عدمت لم يخل عدمها من ثلاثة أحوال: إما أن تعدم مع البدن، وإما أن تعدم من قبل ضد موجود لها، أو تعدم بقدرة القادر."

**English:** As for Islamic philosophers, they responded to Western philosophers with their own logic, to refute their arguments. Ibn Rushd (Averroes) demonstrated that the *nafs* remains eternal after the body's death, and he explained his view based on two positions of al-Ghazali: "If the *nafs* were to cease existing, its cessation would not be free from three possible states: either it ceases to exist along with the body, or it ceases to exist due to some opposing existing force, or it ceases to exist by the power of the All-Powerful."

*LPR: 1.19*

**Arabic:** فالرأس لا يستعمل إلا الحواس، فلا ينال به الانسان إلا المنافع الدنيوية.
