# üöÄ Arabic Translation Editor: Complete Enterprise Enhancement

## üìã MISSION: Transform into Production-Ready Enterprise Translation Platform

You are tasked with implementing **10 critical missing features** to transform this sophisticated Arabic Translation Editor into a production-ready enterprise platform. This system already has advanced infrastructure (hybrid KV/filesystem storage, AI integration, role-based access, sync APIs) but lacks key user-facing features.

## üéØ **PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**

### **üîç 1. GLOBAL SEARCH & NAVIGATION SYSTEM** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**CRITICAL**: 120+ sections with thousands of translations are impossible to navigate without search.

**Implementation Requirements:**
```typescript
// Create app/api/search/route.ts
- Full-text search across all sections (Arabic + English)
- Scripture reference search (e.g., "Mark 1:1", "ŸÖÿ±ŸÇÿ≥ Ÿ°:Ÿ°")
- Fuzzy matching for Arabic text variations
- Search results with section context and highlighting
- Advanced filters: section, completion status, notes count

// Create components/SearchPanel.tsx
- Global search input with keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K)
- Real-time search suggestions as you type
- Search results with snippet previews
- Click to jump directly to section/row
- Search history and saved searches

// Integration Points:
- Add search indexing to data ingestion pipeline
- Create search index from existing triview.json data
- Use existing sections API structure for consistency
```

### **‚ö° 2. REAL-TIME COLLABORATION FRONTEND** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**CRITICAL**: Backend has presence/sync APIs but no frontend real-time updates.

**Implementation Requirements:**
```typescript
// Create lib/realtime/websocket-client.ts
